I used to use  [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) a lot.
PGP has always had its problems. One of which is being over complicated. In 2017 Adobe published its private key on a public [blog](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/09/in-spectacular-fail-adobe-security-team-posts-private-pgp-key-on-blog/). This blog [post](https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html) covers all the bad in PGP
A Google employee has made a more secure encryption system called [Age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age),read the specs yourself [here](http://bit.ly/2t225DS).
Although Age is not even a beta product, it's still in the alpha stage so stay away and don't encrypt anything you aren't ready to see destroyed.

So, I guess I should include my [AGE](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) public key.

Age Public Key

One last test. I promise.
