LGBTQ persons are now protected by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

A great day for equal rights.
The United States Supreme Court [ruled](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/17-1618_hfci.pdf) today that LGBTQ persons are protected by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Short and sweet. Glad to see the lsw catching up with society.

>Justice Neil Gorsuch said, 
"An employer who fired an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids. Those who adopted the Civil Rights Act might not have anticipated their work would lead to this particular result. But the limits of the drafters' imagination supply no reason to ignore the law's demands. Only the written word is the law, and all persons are entitled to its benefit."
